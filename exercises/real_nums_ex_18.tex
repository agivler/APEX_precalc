{\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		12 \div 6 \times 4 - (3-4)^2 &= 12 \div 6 \times 4 - (-1)^2 \\
					     &= 12 \div 6 \times 4 +1 \\
					     &= 12 \div 24 + 1 \\
					     &= \frac{1}{2} + 1 \\
					     &= \frac{3}{2}
	\end{split}
\end{equation*} }
{The final answer is not correct. There are two errors: in the second step, $-(-1)^2$ should give $+1$, not $-1$; in the third step, the division should have been done before the multiplication.}
