{The velocity of periodic waves, $v$, is given by $v=\lambda f$ where $\lambda$ is the length of the waves and $f$ is the frequency of the waves. If the wavelength is held constant while the frequency is tripled, what happens to the velocity of the waves? Be as descriptive as possible.}
{The velocity is tripled.}
