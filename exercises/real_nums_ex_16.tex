{The capacitance, $C$, of a parallel plate capacitor is given by $C=\frac{k \epsilon_0 A}{d}$ where $d$ is the distance between the plates. If $k$, $\epsilon_0$, and $A$ are held constant while the distance between the plates decreases, does the capacitance increase, decrease, or stay the same?}
{The capacitance increases.}
