{A classic calculus problem involves a ladder leaning against a wall. The base of the ladder starts sliding away from the wall causing the top of the ladder to slide down the wall. If you know that the ladder has a length of 13 feet, find the value of $\cos{(\theta)}$ when the base of the ladder is 12 feet away from the wall.}
{$\frac{12}{13}$ if $\theta$ is the angle between the ladder and the floor; $\frac{5}{13}$ if $\theta$ is the angle between the ladder and the wall}
