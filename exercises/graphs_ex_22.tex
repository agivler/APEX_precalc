\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item could $f(x)$ be an even polynomial? Why or why not?
\item could $f(x)$ be an odd polynomial? Why or why not?
\item could $f(x)$ be an exponential function? Why or why not?
\item could $f(x)$ be a trigonometric function? Why or why not?

{\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item no; it is not symmetric about the y-axis
	\item yes; it has rotational symmetry
	\item no; it does not have a horizontal asymptote
	\item no; it does not have a periodic (repeating) pattern
\end{enumerate}}
